Bank Management System 

To run the program, run our main.cpp file as you would in your IDE. 
The program takes the user through two command menus inside the terminal:
1) Login Menu
2) Account Menu

The user should move through the menus by entering the letter that corresponds to the user's desired command. 
Certain areas of the program will require common sense. For example, if the user does not have an account created, the program will return an error. Thus, the user must create an account if he has not used the program before.

We believe that the terminal UI is straight-forward, and based on our user testing, we think that the user can safely open and close the program.
